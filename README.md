# Salve-Mundi
It describes my improbable journey to become a Data Science agent through a blog of thoughts, videos and small, and one day, big achievements
My name is Mario Pastrana. Let me share a bit of a context:
I studied economics at the Universidad de Monterrey (Mexico), where years later I also graduated with an MBA. 
I also studied 80% postgraduate studies in Philosophy, Psychology and Theology. 
In a stretch of just over 16 years, I had a corporate career in low responsibility roles in investment banking, marketing, but later managerial responsibilities in administration, processes and systems, and business development. 
I have some experience in startups. 
In 2017 I was invited as an Adjunct Professor for the University of the Incarnate Word (San Antonio, TX) at the departments of Economics and Business (I taught Microeconomics and International Business during 2017 and 2018. 
Recently I decided to put it on hold to totally focus on my Data Science transition). Regarding this transition, I actually started it in January of 2017, first without knowing and then by revelation. 
So far I have studied 3 out of 5 courses of the online Micromaster "Data, Economic Development and Public Policy" of the MIT (Edx platform), which focuses on "public policy impact evaluation" particularly on poverty relief through tools as of causality, with emphasis on "RTCs". 
One of the courses I have finished this summer is "Data Analysis for Social Scientists" (Probability, Statistics, Models of Causality, Econometrics and Intro to Machine Learning, all using R to solve and analyze). 
At the same time, MIT (in its Edx platform) opened a new Micromaster called "Statisitics and Data Science". Then is when I decided that was the path that I wanted to take. 
Therefore, I am migrating from one program to another. 
This program "Statisitics and Data Science" is starting this coming Monday, September 3, 2018, and it lasts for one year, with a Capstone (final project) next fall. The first two courses I'm taking re "Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data" and "Assessing Data Analysis in Social Science". 
In parallel, my plan is to be able to go over linear algebra, multivariate calculus and Python (I learned some of R, but they are asking to use Python) that is required for next summer for the "Machine Learning" course. 
Finally, also during this same August (in between one program and another), I started a 5-week course in Coursera in "Executive Data Science" by Johns Hopkins, which has to do with the management part of Data Science (I have 2 courses taken so far). I think I will postpone this one until December.
I'm a family man, and among other things I play the guitar.
